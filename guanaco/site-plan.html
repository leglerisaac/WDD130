      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to help travelers to become acquainted with the culture of El Salvador and to understand more of the language, thereby being able to better enjoy their time in the country.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is directed towards tourists going to ElSalvador who want to learn the language better to better enjoy their stay. It will most likely be accessed on a mobile phone while on the go, so it will hae to be a very dynamic and light website.

These are all things we can suppose in order to cater to them.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Basic Information:<br><br>
        Site Purpose:<br>

        <br><br>
        Questions Answered:<br>
        This site will answer questions users have about what common Salvadoran slang words mean and how to use them in common, informal speech to improve their spanish communication. It will also answer questions they have about how to refine their Spanish language skills.
        <br><br>
        Site Activities:<br>
        Visitors will want to be able to easily browse common slang terms and see their definitions. They will also possibly want to submit requests to add other words that they hear in the streets of El Salvador or submit words they know and want others to have definitions of. Another thing they may want to do is to add words themselves with definitions so that the database can grow naturally and quickly.
        <br><br>
        Necessary Information:<br>
        Users will need to have a basic understanding of Spanish to gain benefit from this site. An option to make an account may be helpful so that users can submit word and definition pairs and word requests. Users will not need to make an account to use the website but user experience will be enhanced by making an account.
        <br><br>
        Why My Site?<br>
        Users will use my site instead of others because as of now, there aren't any visually pleasing websites with a large database of words for this topic. Mine would be the first to be a large database, be visually appealing, and to allow user input to allow crowdsourcing database development.
