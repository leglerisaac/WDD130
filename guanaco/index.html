        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>This site helps travelers to become acquainted with the culture and language of El Salvador. This means they will be able to better enjoy their time in the country and better immerse theirselves in the both Salvadoran and Central American culture.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Questions Answered</h2>  
        <p>This site will answer questions users have about what common Salvadoran slang words mean and how to use them in common, informal speech to improve their spanish communication. It will also answer questions they have about how to refine their Spanish language skills.</p>  
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Site Activities</h2>
        <p>Visitors will want to be able to easily browse common slang terms and see their definitions. They will also possibly want to submit requests to add other words that they hear in the streets of El Salvador or submit words they know and want others to have definitions of. Another thing they may want to do is to add words themselves with definitions so that the database can grow naturally and quickly.</p>   
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Necessary Information</h2>
        <p>Users will need to have a basic understanding of Spanish to gain benefit from this site. An option to make an account may be helpful so that users can submit word and definition pairs and word requests. Users will not need to make an account to use the website but user experience will be enhanced by making an account.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Why My Site?</h2>
        <p>Users will use my site instead of others because as of now, there aren't any visually pleasing websites with a large database of words for this topic. Mine would be the first to be a large database, be visually appealing, and to allow user input to allow crowdsourcing database development.</p>
