    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this webiste is to allow prospective customers to see the strengths of our business and eventually decide to raft with us. This website is necessary because in order to compete in the current business environment, a company must have an online presence. This will benefit our rafting company because we will be able to compete with other companies and through good search optimization and an easy to use website, users will find that the best option is our company.</p>
    
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience is people who like to spend time outdoors and people who like adrenaline rushes. We can expand this audience by including aspects of the culture of both groups. We can include new, popular graphics to attract the adrenaline crowd, and use earth tones to attract the outdoorsy crowd. We can use neutral yet new and popular fonts to bring a sense of both novelty and familiarity. This website will most likely be accessed from a mobile phone, so it should be very dynamic and scalable.</p>
